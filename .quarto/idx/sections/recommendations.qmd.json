{"title":"Recommendations","markdown":{"headingText":"Recommendations","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nWe recommend an incremental, iterative approach to implementing the solutions proposed in the previous section, following [agile principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) in order to continuously deliver value to EconDataverse users.\n\nIn the following sub-sections we recommend first steps toward implementing the processes and tools described in the last section.\n\n## Automated code quality tools\n\nWe recommend immediately incorporating code quality tools into existing EconDataverse development workflows, such as [mypy](TKTK ref) type checking, [ruff](TKTK ref) linting, and [black](TKTK ref) formatting for Python. The other code quality tools and practices described in the previous section should be gradually adopted.\n\n## Documentation\n\nMissing and sparse documentation are a clear barrier to adopting EconDataverse tools. For the short term we recommend standardizing the structure and style of existing documentation (primarily READMEs and inline function/method documentation) and adopting the [Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) documentation linter.\n\n## Ontology of economics\n\nWe recommend curating a minimum viable ontology of economics that is sufficient to losslessly capture data originating and metadata originating from key data sources:\n\n* [SDMX](TKTK ref)\n* [Google Data Commons](TKTK ref)\n* [the World Bankâ€™s World Development Indicators (WDI) API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation)\n* [the IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO) database](TKTK ref)\n\n## Adapter library and command line program\n\nWe recommend developing an adapter library in Python and a command line program that uses the library to transform data and metadata to and from an ontology-conformant representation and other formats:\n\n* [SDMX-CSV](TKTK ref)\n* [Google Data Commons](TKTK ref)\n* [RDF](TKTK ref)\n* The tidy tabular formats produced and consumed by existing EconDataverse tools (as a compatibility stop-gap)\n\n## Tool for extracting ontology-conformant data from documents\n\nWe recommend implementing a new tool for extracting ontology-conformant data from a document corpus such as the IMF's [Debt Sustainability Analysis Low-Income Countries (DSA LIC)](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/DSA) reports. The reports comprise a mixture of narrative text, rendered tables, and charts as PDFs. The first release of the tool should focus on extracting statistical data cube-compatible data (dimensions, attributes, measures) from tables in the documents. We recommend experimenting with different libraries and APIs such as [pdfplumber]() and [AWS Textract]() to identify a solution that maximizes key extraction metrics ([precision, recall, F1 score](TKTK ref)).\n\n## Tool for exploring and finding ontology-conformant data and metadata \n\nWe recommend designing and developing a full-stack web application for exploring and finding ontology-conformant data and metadata. The application should consist of:\n\n* a database aggregated from multiple sources via the aforementioned adapter library and extraction tool\n* a reusable library mediating database access\n* a graphical user interface that offers both full-text search and [faceted search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faceted_search)\n\nSearch functionality should be benchmarked against standard information retrieval metrics such as [Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)](TKTK ref). \n\nSubsequent application releases could include additional functionality, such as:\n\n* a [conversational user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversational_user_interface)\n* one or more programmatic interfaces (APIs), such as a [SPARQL endpoint](TKTK ref) or [an SDMX Registry](TKTK ref)\n* support for querying multiple public and private databases, such as [Google Data Commons](TKTK ref)\n\nGiven the relatively small volume of data and their public nature, we recommend considering a [static site generation framework](https://jamstack.org) such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) in order the costs (financial, labor) associated with hosting the application.\n\n## Tool for identifying minimal spreadsheet inputs\n\nWe recommend identifying or developing a tool that accepts a spreadsheet-based financial model such as the [LIC DSF](TKTK ref) or the [Dynamic Debt Toolkit]() and identifies which inputs are required for a subset of desired outputs, in order to avoid spending time populating redundant inputs. There are two fundamental approaches to this problem:\n\n* **White box**: build a [dependency graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_graph) of spreadsheet formulas spanning the inputs and outputs in order to identify which inputs the desired outputs depend on. This approach is likely to produce false positives -- flagging a set of inputs larger than the true minimum -- because it is insensitive to the magnitude of input changes.\n* **Black box**: mutate individual inputs and combinations of inputs and record which outputs change. This approach may produce false negatives -- flagging a set of inputs smaller than the true minimum -- because of untested interactions between inputs.\n\nIdeally a tool will utilize both approaches to check each other.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"recommendations.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
