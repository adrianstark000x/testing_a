# Introduction

Sovereign advisory is the specialized guidance provided to sovereign entities—particularly Ministries of Finance (MOF) and their Debt Management Offices (DMOs)—to strengthen the management of public debt, fiscal policy, and macroeconomic risks. The mission of a sovereign advisor is vital to improving debt sustainability, enhancing access to capital markets, and enabling governments to make informed, data-driven policy decisions that foster long-term economic stability and growth.

Modern technologies offer a powerful pathway forward for transforming sovereign advisory work. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies—especially large language models (LLMs)—alongside advanced data systems such as knowledge graphs and ontologies, present a significant opportunity to enhance the capabilities of sovereign analysts. The ability of LLMs to identify and extract information from both structured and unstructured data makes them valuable tools for uncovering insights from complex macroeconomic datasets and policy documents. Knowledge graphs and ontologies structure economic, legal, and financial data in ways that make it more interoperable, findable, and reusable. Together, these technologies can streamline labor-intensive workflows and support more consistent, timely, and data-driven decision-making.

This report explores how AI-powered platforms, when combined with robust data technologies, can unlock new levels of efficiency and effectiveness in sovereign advisory. It provides a detailed analysis of current technologies, workflows, and pain points within the sovereign debt management landscape, identifying key bottlenecks that hinder productivity and insight generation. Building on that analysis, it presents a roadmap for developing tools—along with the associated standards, conventions, and best practices—that will help eliminate toil and enhance the efficiency of both sovereign advisors and resource-constrained DMOs.

Finally, the report offers strategic recommendations for the EconDataverse toolkit. These include long-term foundational technologies and high-level data and software architectures to guide its growth—supporting increased data volume, source heterogeneity, and stakeholder diversity, while maximizing its impact on data-driven sovereign advisory work.
